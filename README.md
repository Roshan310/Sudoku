# Sudoku

A simulation of a standard game of Sudoku with a `9 X 9` grid, with `3 X 3` sub-grids.
\
The goal is to fill each sub-grid with numbers 1-9 such that no number repeats.
\
Likewise, no number should be repeated in its own row or column.
And no number should be repeated in its sub-grid too.
